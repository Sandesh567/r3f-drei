//*   Installing drei   *//
npm install @react-three/drei@9.32

//Import orbitControls from @react-three/drei

<OrbitControls/>
1. enableDamping
2. makeDefault

avoiding camera from moving while transform controls

parameters in the orbit controls enableDamping is true by default
enableDamping means smooth animation .

//Allows user to drag and drop. gizmo effect
<TransformControls>
<mesh and geometry/>
<TransformControls/>

solution for sticking with the cube is 
using ref and providing ref to the mesh and inside transform control use object to 
provide the cube.

We can provide modes for the controls like rotate and scale 
<TransformControls mode ="rotate/scale/translate"/>


//Same as TransformControls but provides more features.
import and warp the mesh .
<PivotCOntrols>
    mesh& geo
</PivotCOntrols>

To see the helper above the object we use 
anchor={[0,1,1]} and 
depthTest={false} 
lineWidth ={4} //for width of  the line
axisColors={["color",'color' ,'color']} //color of the lines
scale={2} //increasing size of the lines
fixed={true} //makes the size same even from the distant perspective

//Adding text using Html 
import html from drei
<Html>Text </Html>

There is no camera on the text so add distance factor ie; 
distanceFactor={4}

using occlude
//occlude means hiding the text when some shape comes infront of the text
to use this first useref and provide ref to the mesh and inside html
occlude={[sphere, cube]}

//styling by html class definition 
wrapperClass ="label"

then target in CSS

//Text
Import the Text
<Text >your text</Text>
We can use our own fonts, the default font is roboto
we can use the property font="path of font"
Always use the woff format and for it you can use google-webfonts-helper
fontSize , color, meshNormalMaterial, position we can use these property

//float helps to object move and float like balloon in the air

<Float>
Wrap inside any component such as text or geometry
</Float>

You can use two float in text and in mesh at the same time
you can change the speed by using 
speed={5} 
and 
floatIntensity={2}
